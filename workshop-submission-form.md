## Title

Can I migrate from Docker to Podman?

## Abstract

The use of operating-system-level virtualization, also known as containerization, has been dominated by Docker but other tools are available, for example Podman. Podman is advocated as drop-in replacement for Docker with better security and closer cooperation with Kubernetes, a popular container orchestrator. The Docker licensing drama also contributed for the search of viable alternatives to Docker. In this workshops, junior RSEs will have their first contact with Podman and RSEs with years of experience with Docker will learn how to migrate their advance configuration from developmento to production into Podman.

## Prerequisites

Attendees are required to be familiar with the command line available on their operating system.

Attendees using Windows are required to have at least Windows 10 configured and are recommended to also have Windows Subsystem for Linux configured.

Attendees are NOT required to be familiar with Docker.

## Outcomes

Attendees will be more knowledge of Podman as an viable alternative to Docker. Attendees who migrated to Podman will have a more secure environment and save the cost of their Docker license fee.

## Technical Plan

The workshop will be delivered as a Carpentry-style live coding to provide the attendees with hand-ons experience operating Podman. For that, attendees should bring along their laptop.

Podman is free and open source software. Access to Podman is free of charge from the project website.

The content of the workshop is available online at https://rse-podman-tutorial.readthedocs.io/ and it will be used as a way to share piece of code with the attendees.
