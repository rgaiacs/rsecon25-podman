## Title

Can I migrate from Docker to Podman?

## Abstract

The use of operating-system-level virtualization, also known as containerization, has been dominated by Docker but other ecosystems are available, for example Apptainer and Podman. Podman is advocated as drop-in replacement for Docker with better security. In this workshops, attendees will learn how to migrate their advance Docker configuration from developmento to production into Podman, including when using Windows and macOS.

## Prerequisites

Attendees are required to be familiar with the command line available on their operating system.

Attendees using Windows are required to have at least Windows 10 configured and it is recommended to also have Windows Subsystem for Linux configured.

Attendees are NOT required to be familiar with Docker.

## Outcomes

Attendees will be more knowledge of Podman as an alternative to Docker. Attendees who migrated to Podman will have a more secure environment and save the cost of their Docker license fee.

## Technical Plan

The workshop will be delivered as a Carpentry-style live coding to provide the attendees with hand-ons experience operating Docker. For that, attendees should bring along their laptop.

Access to Podman and Podman Desktop is free of charge from the respective project website.

The content of the workshop is available online at https://rse-podman-tutorial.readthedocs.io/ and it will be used as a way to share piece of code with the attendees.
